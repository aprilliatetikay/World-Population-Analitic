🌍 World Population Analysis using PostgreSQL

📌 1. Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing world population data using PostgreSQL. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from population statistics, such as population density, migration trends, fertility rates, and continent-based segmentation.

✅ Key Analysis Performed:

Data Processing & Table Creation: Structuring population data in a PostgreSQL database.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extracting insights on population trends.

Filtering & Aggregation: Identifying high-density regions, countries with negative population growth, and migration patterns.

Subqueries & Grouping: Summarizing data by continents and calculating averages.

📂 2. Dataset Overview

The dataset contains world population statistics for 2024, including various demographic and economic indicators.

Features in the dataset:

Country: Name of the country

Population 2024: Total population in 2024

Yearly Change: Annual percentage change in population

Net Change: Absolute population change per year

Density: Population density (people per km²)

Land Area: Total land area of the country

Migrants Net: Net migration count

Fertility Rate: Average number of children per woman

Median Age: Median age of the population

Urban Population Percent: Percentage of people living in urban areas

World Share: Share of the world population (%)

📈 3. Key Insights from the Analysis

✅ Countries with extreme density (>500 people/km²) are mostly small nations or highly urbanized regions.

✅ Urbanization is high (>80%) in many developed countries, often linked with lower fertility rates.

✅ Some countries experience negative population growth, mainly due to aging populations and low birth rates.

✅ Fertility rates vary significantly, with some nations exceeding 4.0 while others are below 1.5.

✅ Net migration trends highlight economic opportunities, with some countries attracting large numbers of migrants.

✅ Asia and Africa have the largest population shares, while Europe has an aging population with slower growth.

📌 4. Conclusion

This project showcases how PostgreSQL can be leveraged for world population analysis, providing valuable insights into demographic trends, migration, fertility, and urbanization. SQL queries help extract meaningful patterns that can inform policy decisions and economic planning.
